# pacmen
## Description of project
This is a course project that is intended to practice how to build a Document Object Model (DOM) and let JavaScript and HTML interact with the browser to make the web page functional.
## How to run
Click the button "Add PacMan" to create a brand new PacMan, that has a randomized position and velocity.
Click the button "Start Game" to allow the PacMan(s) you created to move around. The PacMan(s) will hit the walls (which are boarders of the browser window) and bounce back.
## Roadmap of future improvements
Add another button to stop the movement.
Add another button to reset the game.
